This master project aims to assess Norwayâ€™s 5G maturity based on measurements performed in real-world implementations, referred to as "5G in the wild." This repository contains code and guides for how to reproduce my setup for doing both performance and security measurements of LTE and 5G.

##Note about the use of AI to generate code
Cursor AI was used to generate some of the code in this repository.


## Logfiles /logfiles:
Logfiles are stored under /logfiles. 

## Notebooks /notebooks:
Jupyter notebooks are used to handle the processing of logfiles. 

## Configurations /configs

## Raspberry PI code /raspi
Speedtest-cli used on the Raspberry PI 4 is https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli. It is a python script that uses the speedtest.net API to get the speed of the internet connection. This will be installed on the Raspberry PI and run continuously to collect data.
